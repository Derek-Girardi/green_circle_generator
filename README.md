# green_circle_generator (NAME PENDING)

A simple app that will provide random questions from a pool of questions. There are levels of "complexity" and the user can choose which level they are wanting to work with. This was an idea for a classroom setting with students for special needs, this will help the teacher get a general idea on how their students are feeling that day and this will allow fresh questions. 
Previously an access database was being used and being displayed onto an excel spreadsheet and this is highly ineffcient so we came up with this app. 
Its very much a WIP and a learning tool for me so bear with me and bad decisions.
